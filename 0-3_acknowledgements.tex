I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Joshua Vaughan, who has provided guidance during this process and even stayed on as my advisor after transferring to Oak Ridge National Lab despite the extra effort of having a remote student.

I would also like to thank the members of the \textsl{\textbf{\textsf{C.R.A.W.LAB}}} and other students in our lab, namely my undergraduate research assistant, Thomas Poch\'{e}, who assisted with experiments, and Andrew Albright and Nalaka Amarasiri for the numerous discussions and feedback that were vital to improving this work.

Finally, I cannot neglect to thank all of my family and friends who have provided copious amounts of support and encouragement that have so often reinvigorated me during this lengthy endeavor.
