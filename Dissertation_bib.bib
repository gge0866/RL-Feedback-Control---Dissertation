	Abstract = {Aimed at the lack of self-tuning PID parameters in conventional PID controllers, the structure and learning algorithm of an adaptive PID controller based on reinforcement learning were proposed. Actor-Critic learning was used to tune PID parameters in an adaptive way by taking advantage of the model-free and on-line learning properties of re-inforcement learning effectively. In order to reduce the demand of storage space and to improve the learning efficiency, a single RBF neural network was used to approximate the policy function of Actor and the value function of Critic si-multaneously. The inputs of RBF network are the system error, as well as the first and the second-order differences of error. The Actor can realize the mapping from the system state to PID parameters, while the Critic evaluates the outputs of the Actor and produces TD error. Based on TD error performance index and gradient descent method, the updating rules of RBF kernel function and network weights were given. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is efficient for complex nonlinear systems and it is perfectly adaptable and strongly robust, which is better than that of a conventional PID controller.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT
A number of reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed that are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution when used with lookup tables. It is shown, however, that these algorithms can easily become unstable when implemented directly with a general function-approximation system, such as a sigmoidal multilayer perceptron, a radial-basis-function system, a memory-based learning system, or even a linear function-approximation system. A new class of algorithms, residual gradient algorithms, is proposed, which perform gradient descent on the mean squared Bellman residual, guaranteeing convergence. It is shown, however, that they may learn very slowly in some cases. A larger class of algorithms, residual algorithms, is proposed that has the guaranteed convergence of the residual gradient algorithms, yet can retain the fast learning speed of direct algorithms. In fact, both direct and residual gradient algorithms are shown to be special cases of residual algorithms, and it is shown that residual algorithms can combine the advantages of each approach. The direct, residual gradient, and residual forms of value iteration, Q-learning, and advantage learning are all presented. Theoretical analysis is given explaining the properties these algorithms have, and simulation results are given that demonstrate these properties.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning is as growing as fast as concepts such as Big data and the field of data science in general. The purpose of the systematic review was to analyze scholarly articles that were published between 2015 and 2018 addressing or implementing supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques in different problem-solving paradigms. Using the elements of PRISMA, the review process identified 84 scholarly articles that had been published in different journals. Of the 84 articles, 6 were published before 2015 despite their metadata indicating that they were published in 2015. The existence of the six articles in the final papers was attributed to errors in indexing. Nonetheless, from the reviewed papers, decision tree, support vector machine, and Na{\"\i}ve Bayes algorithms appeared to be the most cited, discussed, and implemented supervised learners. Conversely, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis also emerged as the commonly used unsupervised learners. The review also revealed other commonly used algorithms that include ensembles and reinforce learners, and future systematic reviews can focus on them because of the developments that machine learning and data science is undergoing at the moment.},

@article{Mankins:2009a,
	Abstract = {The development of new system capabilities typically depends upon the prior success of advanced technology research and development efforts. These systems developments inevitably face the three major challenges of any project: performance, schedule and budget. Done well, advanced technology programs can substantially reduce the uncertainty in all three of these dimensions of project management. Done poorly, or not at all, and new system developments suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays and the steady erosion of initial performance objectives. It is often critical for senior management to be able to determine which of these two paths is more likely---and to respond accordingly. The challenge for system and technology managers is to be able to make clear, well-documented assessments of technology readiness and risks, and to do so at key points in the life cycle of the program. In the mid 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the concept of ``technology readiness levels'' (TRLs) as a discipline-independent, programmatic figure of merit (FOM) to allow more effective assessment of, and communication regarding the maturity of new technologies. In 1995, the TRL scale was further strengthened by the articulation of the first definitions of each level, along with examples (J. Mankins, Technology readiness levels, A White Paper, NASA, Washington, DC, 1995. [1]). Since then, TRLs have been embraced by the U.S. Congress' General Accountability Office (GAO), adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and are being considered for use by numerous other organizations. Overall, the TRLs have proved to be highly effective in communicating the status of new technologies among sometimes diverse organizations. This paper will review the concept of ``technology readiness assessments'', and provide a retrospective on the history of ``TRLs'' during the past 30 years. The paper will conclude with observations concerning prospective future directions for the important discipline of technology readiness assessments.},

It empowers Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Deep Learning (DL) techniques to address various difficult tasks. In this paper, a novel approach called the Genetic Algorithm of Neuron Coverage (GANC) is proposed. It is motivated for improving the robustness and performance of a DRL network. The GANC uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to maximise the Neuron Coverage (NC) of a DRL network by producing augmented inputs. We apply this method in the self-driving car applications, where it is crucial to accurately provide a correct decision for different road tracking views. We evaluate our method on the SYNTHIA-SEQS-05 databases in four different driving environments. Our outcomes are very promising -- the best driving accuracy reached 97.75% -- and are superior to the state-of-the-art results.},

	Abstract = {Modern production systems face enormous challenges due to rising customer requirements resulting in complex production systems. The operational efficiency in the competitive industry is ensured by an adequate production control system that manages all operations in order to optimize key performance indicators. Currently, control systems are mostly based on static and model-based heuristics, requiring significant human domain knowledge and, hence, do not match the dynamic environment of manufacturing companies. Data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) showed compelling results in applications such as board and computer games as well as first production applications. This paper addresses the design of RL to create an adaptive production control system by the real-world example of order dispatching in a complex job shop. As RL algorithms are ``black box''approaches, they inherently prohibit a comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, the experience with advanced RL algorithms is still limited to single successful applications, which limits the transferability of results. In this paper, we examine the performance of the state, action, and reward function RL design. When analyzing the results, we identify robust RL designs. This makes RL an advantageous control system for highly dynamic and complex production systems, mainly when domain knowledge is limited.},

	Abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found limited success beyond simulated applications, and one main reason is the absence of safety guarantees &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the learning process. Real world systems would realistically fail or break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs) and (3) online learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based controllers both &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; safety and &lt;em&gt;guide&lt;/em&gt; the learning process by constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used, and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous carfollowing with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and show that our algorithm attains much greater sample efficiency in learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; maintains safety during the entire learning process.&lt;/p&gt;},

	Abstract = {Effective control of ride quality and handling performance are challenges for active vehicle suspension systems, particularly for off-road applications. The nonlinearities tend to degrade the performance of active suspension systems; these introduce harshness to the ride quality and reduce off-road mobility. Typical control strategies rely on linear models of the suspension dynamics. While these models are convenient, nominally accurate, and controllable due to the abundance of linear control techniques, they neglect the nonlinearities present in real suspension systems. The techniques already implemented and methods used to cope with problem of Half-Car model were studied. Every method and technique had some drawbacks in terms of complexity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of real time implementation. In this paper, an improved control method for Half-Car model was proposed. First, input/output feedback linearization was performed to convert the nonlinear system of Half-Car model into an equivalent linear system. This was followed by a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. This controller had minimized the effects of road disturbances by designing a gain matrix with optimal robustness properties. The proposed control technique was applied in the presence of the deterministic road disturbance. The results were verified using the Matlab/Simulink toolbox.},

The approximation is comprised of two steps. First, successive approximation is used to reduce the HJB equation to a sequence of linear partial differential equations. These equations are then approximated via the Galerkin spectral method. The resulting algorithm has several important advantages over previously reported methods. Namely, the resulting control is in feedback form and its associated region of attraction is well defined. In addition, all computations are performed off-line and the control can be made arbitrarily close to optimal. Accordingly, this paper presents a new tool for designing nonlinear control systems that adhere to a prescribed integral performance criterion.},

Simulation results prove the ability and effectiveness of iLQR controller to successfully track different paths by the leader and maintain the relative distance between the leader and the follower by the follower. It also shows that iLQR controller outperforms LQR controller in terms of fast convergence and tracking errors. },

@article{Schwenzer:2021a,
	Abstract = {Model-based predictive control (MPC) describes a set of advanced control methods, which make use of a process model to predict the future behavior of the controlled system. By solving a---potentially constrained---optimization problem, MPC determines the control law implicitly. This shifts the effort for the design of a controller towards modeling of the to-be-controlled process. Since such models are available in many fields of engineering, the initial hurdle for applying control is deceased with MPC. Its implicit formulation maintains the physical understanding of the system parameters facilitating the tuning of the controller. Model-based predictive control (MPC) can even control systems, which cannot be controlled by conventional feedback controllers. With most of the theory laid out, it is time for a concise summary of it and an application-driven survey. This review article should serve as such. While in the beginnings of MPC, several widely noticed review paper have been published, a comprehensive overview on the latest developments, and on applications, is missing today. This article reviews the current state of the art including theory, historic evolution, and practical considerations to create intuitive understanding. We lay special attention on applications in order to demonstrate what is already possible today. Furthermore, we provide detailed discussion on implantation details in general and strategies to cope with the computational burden---still a major factor in the design of MPC. Besides key methods in the development of MPC, this review points to the future trends emphasizing why they are the next logical steps in MPC.},

	Abstract = {This article reviews the recent development of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with applications in control. First, its applications in optimal regulation are introduced, and some skilled and efficient algorithms are presented. Next, the use of ADP to solve game problems, mainly nonzero-sum game problems, is elaborated. It is followed by applications in large-scale systems. Note that although the functions presented in this article are based on continuous-time systems, various applications of ADP in discrete-time systems are also analyzed. Moreover, in each section, not only some existing techniques are discussed, but also possible directions for future work are pointed out. Finally, some overall prospects for the future are given, followed by conclusions of this article. Through a comprehensive and complete investigation of its applications in many existing fields, this article fully demonstrates that the ADP intelligent control method is promising in today's artificial intelligence era. Furthermore, it also plays a significant role in promoting economic and social development.},

The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function. This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. Deterministic policy gradient algorithms outperformed their stochastic counterparts in several benchmark problems, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces.},

	Abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has seen several successful applications to process control. Common methods rely on a deep neural network structure to model the controller or process. With increasingly complicated control structures, the closed-loop stability of such methods becomes less clear. In this work, we focus on the interpretability of DRL control methods. In particular, we view linear fixed-structure controllers as shallow neural networks embedded in the actor-critic framework. PID controllers guide our development due to their simplicity and acceptance in industrial practice. We then consider input saturation, leading to a simple nonlinear control structure. In order to effectively operate within the actuator limits we then incorporate a tuning parameter for anti-windup compensation. Finally, the simplicity of the controller allows for straightforward initialization. This makes our method inherently stabilizing, both during and after training, and amenable to known operational PID gains.},

	Abstract = { This article surveys reinforcement learning from the perspective of optimization and control, with a focus on continuous control applications. It reviews the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning as well as competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges. },

	Abstract = {Learning physics-based locomotion skills is a difficult problem, leading to solutions
that typically exploit prior knowledge of various forms. In this paper we aim to learn
a variety of environment-aware locomotion skills with a limited amount of prior knowledge.
We adopt a two-level hierarchical control framework. First, low-level controllers
are learned that operate at a fine timescale and which achieve robust walking gaits
that satisfy stepping-target and style objectives. Second, high-level controllers
are then learned which plan at the timescale of steps by invoking desired step targets
for the low-level controller. The high-level controller makes decisions directly based
on high-dimensional inputs, including terrain maps or other suitable representations
of the surroundings. Both levels of the control policy are trained using deep reinforcement
learning. Results are demonstrated on a simulated 3D biped. Low-level controllers
are learned for a variety of motion styles and demonstrate robustness with respect
to force-based disturbances, terrain variations, and style interpolation. High-level
controllers are demonstrated that are capable of following trails through terrains,
dribbling a soccer ball towards a target location, and navigating through static or
dynamic obstacles.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement Learning is a framework for algorithms that learn by interacting with an unknown environment. In recent years, combining this approach with deep learning has led to major advances in various fields. Numerous hyperparameters -- e.g. the learning rate -- influence the learning process and are usually determined by testing some variations. This selection strongly influences the learning result and requires a lot of time and experience. The automation of this process has the potential to make Deep Reinforcement Learning available to a wider audience and to achieve superior results. This paper presents a model-based hyperparameter optimization of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and demonstrates it with a hybrid vehicle energy management environment. In the given case, the hyperparameter optimization is able to double the gained reward value of the DDPG agent.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},

Each quadrotor dynamics exhibits the features of underactuation, high nonlinearities and couplings, and disturbances in both the translational and rotational motions. A distributed robust controller is developed, which consists of a position controller to govern the translational motion for the desired formation and an attitude controller to control the rotational motion of each quadrotor. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies of a formation of multiple uncertain quadrotors are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control scheme.},

	Abstract = {Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) offer a formal model for planning in cooperative multiagent systems where agents operate with noisy sensors and actuators, as well as local information. Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model based---limitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well.},

A learned policy is the product of the problem to be solved, as embodied by the RL environment, and the RL algorithm. While enormous attention has been devoted to RL algorithms, much less is known about the impact of design choices for the RL environment. In this paper, we show that environment design matters in significant ways and document how it can contribute to the brittle nature of many RL results. Specifically, we examine choices related to state representations, initial state distributions, reward structure, control frequency, episode termination procedures, curriculum usage, the action space, and the torque limits. We aim to stimulate discussion around such choices, which in practice strongly impact the success of RL when applied to continuous-action control problems of interest to animation, such as learning to locomote.},

	Abstract = {Unlike the many soft computing applications where it suffices to achieve a "good approximation most of the time," a control system must be stable all of the time. As such, if one desires to learn a control law in real-time, a fusion of soft computing techniques to learn the appropriate control law with hard computing techniques to maintain the stability constraint and guarantee convergence is required. The objective of the paper is to describe an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm (ADPA) which fuses soft computing techniques to learn the optimal cost (or return) functional for a stabilizable nonlinear system with unknown dynamics and hard computing techniques to verify the stability and convergence of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is initialized with a (stabilizing) cost functional and the system is run with the corresponding control law (defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation), with the resultant state trajectories used to update the cost functional in a soft computing mode. Hard computing techniques are then used to show that this process is globally convergent with stepwise stability to the optimal cost functional/control law pair for an (unknown) input affine system with an input quadratic performance measure (modulo the appropriate technical conditions). Three specific implementations of the ADPA are developed for 1) the linear case, 2) for the nonlinear case using a locally quadratic approximation to the cost functional, and 3) the nonlinear case using a radial basis function approximation of the cost functional; illustrated by applications to flight control.},

	Abstract = {Convergence of the value-iteration-based heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) algorithm is proven in the case of general nonlinear systems. That is, it is shown that HDP converges to the optimal control and the optimal value function that solves the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation appearing in infinite-horizon discrete-time (DT) nonlinear optimal control. It is assumed that, at each iteration, the value and action update equations can be exactly solved. The following two standard neural networks (NN) are used: a critic NN is used to approximate the value function, whereas an action network is used to approximate the optimal control policy. It is stressed that this approach allows the implementation of HDP without knowing the internal dynamics of the system. The exact solution assumption holds for some classes of nonlinear systems and, specifically, in the specific case of the DT linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the action is linear and the value quadratic in the states and NNs have zero approximation error.

	Abstract = { Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research. },

Relevant literature reveals a plethora of methods, but at the same time makes clear the lack of implementations for dealing with real life challenges. Current expectations raise the demand for adaptable robots. We argue that, by employing model-based reinforcement learning, the---now limited---adaptability characteristics of robotic systems can be expanded. Also, model-based reinforcement learning exhibits advantages that makes it more applicable to real life use-cases compared to model-free methods. Thus, in this survey, model-based methods that have been applied in robotics are covered. We categorize them based on the derivation of an optimal policy, the definition of the returns function, the type of the transition model and the learned task. Finally, we discuss the applicability of model-based reinforcement learning approaches in new applications, taking into consideration the state of the art in both algorithms and hardware.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully employed as a powerful tool in designing adaptive optimal controllers. Recently, off-policy learning has emerged to design optimal controllers for systems with completely unknown dynamics. However, current approaches for optimal tracking control design either result in bounded tracking error, rather than zero tracking error, or require partial knowledge of the system dynamics. Moreover, they usually require to collect a large set of data to learn the optimal solution. To obviate these limitations, this paper applies a combination of off-policy learning and experience-replay for output regulation tracking control of continuous-time linear systems with completely unknown dynamics. To this end, the off-policy integral RL-based technique is first used to obtain the optimal control feedback gain, and to explicitly identify the involved system dynamics using the same data. Second, a data-efficient-based experience replay method is developed to compute the exosystem dynamics. Finally, the output regulator equations are solved using data measured online. It is shown that the proposed control method stabilizes the closed-loop tracking error dynamics, and gives an explicit exponential convergence rate for the output tracking error. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	Abstract = {Learning-based approaches are suitable for the control of systems with unknown dynamics. However, learning from scratch involves many trials with exploratory actions until a good control policy is discovered. Real robots usually cannot withstand the exploratory actions and suffer damage. This problem can be circumvented by combining learning with a model-based control. In this letter, we employ a nominal model-predictive controller that is impeded by the presence of an unknown model-plant mismatch. To compensate for the mismatch, we propose two approaches of combining reinforcement learning with the nominal controller. The first approach learns a compensatory control action that minimizes the same performance measure as is minimized by the nominal controller. The second approach learns a compensatory signal from a difference of a transition predicted by the internal model and an actual transition. We compare the approaches on a robot attached to the ground and performing a setpoint reaching task in simulations. We implement the better approach on the real robot and demonstrate successful learning results.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) methods enable us to construct a learning controller that acquires an appropriate control law tailored to a controlled object through trial and error (exploration). However, the exploring property is problematic when we apply RL methods to real world industrial problems, since it is difficult to maintain the control performance during learning. On the other hand, model-based control methods enable us to construct an appropriate controller based on known information (a mathematical model) of the controlled object. However, achievable control performance depends on the precision of the model and does not improve once the design procedure is finished. As a countermeasure for these issues, we introduce a notion of control approach "LeFiCo" in which a learning controller based on an RL method and a fixed (non-learning) controller are used simultaneously, and we propose a new method included in LeFiCo using an RL-based learning controller and a linear quadratic regulator in parallel for a class of nonlinear adaptive optimal control problems. We also conduct a theoretical analysis of this proposed method from the viewpoint of an RL problem, and we illustrate the validity and effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations.},

The paper first introduces the concept of significance for the hidden neurons and then uses it in the learning algorithm to realize parsimonious networks. The growing and pruning strategy of GGAP-RBF is based on linking the required learning accuracy with the significance of the nearest or intentionally added new neuron. Significance of a neuron is a measure of the average information content of that neuron. The GGAP-RBF algorithm can be used for any arbitrary sampling density for training samples and is derived from a rigorous statistical point of view. Simulation results for bench mark problems in the function approximation area show that the GGAP-RBF outperforms several other sequential learning algorithms in terms of learning speed, network size and generalization performance regardless of the sampling density function of the training data.},

In this paper, a data-based off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed, which learns the solution of the HJBE and the optimal control policy from real system data. One important feature of the off-policy RL is that its policy evaluation can be realized with data generated by other behavior policies, not necessarily the target policy, which solves the insufficient exploration problem. The convergence of the off-policy RL is proved by demonstrating its equivalence to the successive approximation approach. Its implementation procedure is based on the actor--critic neural networks structure, where the function approximation is conducted with linearly independent basis functions. Subsequently, the convergence of the implementation procedure with function approximation is also proved. Finally, its effectiveness is verified through computer simulations.},

The proposed intelligent optimal RWENN control system (IORWENNCS) incorporating an optimal controller, a RWENN controller and a robust controller. Based on the principle of optimal control, a position tracking controller is designed to minimize a quadratic performance index. In addition, a RWENN controller with accurate approximation capability is used to approximate a nonlinear function in the optimal control law. Moreover, a robust controller with adaptive bound estimation algorithm is proposed to confront the approximation error. The online adaptive control laws are derived based on the optimal control technique and Lyapunov stability analysis, so that the stability of the IORWENNCS can be guaranteed. Using the proposed control scheme, the position tracking performance is substantially improved and the robustness to uncertainties can be obtained as well. All control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C31 DSP-based control computer. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed IORWENNCS grants robust performance and precise tracking response regardless of load disturbances and PMSM uncertainties.},

It is shown that the constrained optimal control law has the largest region of asymptotic stability (RAS). The value function of this HJB equation is solved for by solving for a sequence of cost functions satisfying a sequence of Lyapunov equations (LE). A neural network is used to approximate the cost function associated with each LE using the method of least-squares on a well-defined region of attraction of an initial stabilizing controller. As the order of the neural network is increased, the least-squares solution of the HJB equation converges uniformly to the exact solution of the inherently nonlinear HJB equation associated with the saturating control inputs.

The rigid robotic manipulator is described as a multiinput and multioutput system. Adaptive neural network (NN) control for the robotic system with full-state constraints is designed. In the control design, the adaptive NNs are adopted to handle system uncertainties and disturbances. The Moore-Penrose inverse term is employed in order to prevent the violation of the full-state constraints. A barrier Lyapunov function is used to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. The control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by appropriately choosing the design parameters. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.},

The system considered is described by an unknown NARMA model, and a feedforward neural network is used to learn the system. Taking the neural network as a neural model of the system, control signals are directly obtained by minimizing either the instant difference or the cumulative differences between a set point and the output of the neural model. Since the training algorithm guarantees that the output of the neural model approaches that of the actual system, it is shown that the control signals obtained can also make the real system output close to the set point. An application to a flow-rate control system is included to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and desired results are obtained.},

The parameters of a crane system may vary from each transport, therefore the anti‐sway controller should be designed to be insensitive to the variation of system parameters. In this paper, we focus on pure neural network adaptive tracking controller design issue that does not require the parameters of crane systems, i.e. the trolley mass, the payload mass, the cable lengths, and etc. The proposed neural network controller only requires the output feedback signals of the trolley, i.e. the position and the velocity, which means no sway measuring equipment is needed. The Lyapunov method is utilized to design the weights update law of neural network, and the robustness of the proposed controller is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. The results of numerical simulations show that the proposed neural network controller has excellent performance of trolley position tracking and payload anti‐sway controlling.}},

This survey, at first time, gives a systematic and comprehensive tutorial and summary on the existing disturbance/uncertainty estimation and attenuation techniques, most notably, DOBC, active disturbance rejection control, disturbance accommodation control, and composite hierarchical antidisturbance control. In all of these methods, disturbance and uncertainty are, in general, lumped together, and an observation mechanism is employed to estimate the total disturbance. This paper first reviews a number of widely used linear and nonlinear disturbance/uncertainty estimation techniques and then discusses and compares various compensation techniques and the procedures of integrating disturbance/uncertainty compensation with a (predesigned) linear/nonlinear controller. It also provides concise tutorials of the main methods in this area with clear descriptions of their features. The application of this group of methods in various industrial sections is reviewed, with emphasis on the commercialization of some algorithms.

	Abstract = {Designing effective low-level robot controllers often entail platform-specific implementations that require manual heuristic parameter tuning, significant system knowledge, or long design times. With the rising number of robotic and mechatronic systems deployed across areas ranging from industrial automation to intelligent toys, the need for a general approach to generating low-level controllers is increasing. To address the challenge of rapidly generating low-level controllers, we argue for using model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) trained on relatively small amounts of automatically generated (i.e., without system simulation) data. In this letter, we explore the capabilities of MBRL on a Crazyflie centimeter-scale quadrotor with rapid dynamics to predict and control at ≤50 Hz. To our knowledge, this is the first use of MBRL for controlled hover of a quadrotor using only on-board sensors, direct motor input signals, and no initial dynamics knowledge. Our controller leverages rapid simulation of a neural network forward dynamics model on a graphic processing unit enabled base station, which then transmits the best current action to the quadrotor firmware via radio. In our experiments, the quadrotor achieved hovering capability of up to 6 s with 3 min of experimental training data.},

	Abstract = { Designing distributed controllers for self-reconfiguring modular robots has been consistently challenging. We have developed a reinforcement learning approach which can be used both to automate controller design and to adapt robot behavior on-line. In this paper, we report on our study of reinforcement learning in the domain of self-reconfigurable modular robots: the underlying assumptions, the applicable algorithms and the issues of partial observability, large search spaces and local optima. We propose and validate experimentally in simulation a number of techniques designed to address these and other scalability issues that arise in applying machine learning to distributed systems such as modular robots. We discuss ways to make learning faster, more robust and amenable to on-line application by giving scaffolding to the learning agents in the form of policy representation, structured experience and additional information. With enough structure modular robots can run learning algorithms to both automate the generation of distributed controllers, and adapt to the changing environment and deliver on the self-organization promise with less interference from human designers, programmers and operators. },

External disturbances, control input nonlinearities and model uncertainties are considered in our control design. Based on the dynamics model derived in the discrete-time domain, two neural networks (NNs), including a critic and an action NN, are integrated into our adaptive control design. The critic NN is introduced to evaluate the long-time performance of the designed control in the current time step, and the action NN is used to compensate for the unknown dynamics. To eliminate the AUV's control input nonlinearities, a compensation item is also designed in the adaptive control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to prove the stability and performance of the proposed control law. Moreover, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control method are tested and validated through extensive numerical simulation results.},

Firstly, under the conditions of the system output and its time derivatives being available for feedback, an adaptive state feedback NN controller is developed. When only the output is measurable, by using a high-gain observer to estimate the derivatives of the system output, an adaptive output feedback NN controller is proposed. The closed-loop system is proven to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). In addition, if the approximation accuracy of the neural networks is high enough and the observer gain is chosen sufficiently large, an arbitrarily small tracking error can be achieved.

Reinforcement learning is bridging the gap between traditional optimal control, adaptive control and bio-inspired learning techniques borrowed from animals. This work is highlighting some of the key techniques presented by well known researchers from the combined areas of reinforcement learning and optimal control theory. At the end, an example of an implementation of a novel model-free Q-learning based discrete optimal adaptive controller for a humanoid robot arm is presented. The controller uses a novel adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) reinforcement learning (RL) approach to develop an optimal policy on-line. The RL joint space tracking controller was implemented for two links (shoulder flexion and elbow flexion joints) of the arm of the humanoid Bristol-Elumotion-Robotic-Torso II (BERT II) torso. The constrained case (joint limits) of the RL scheme was tested for a single link (elbow flexion) of the BERT II arm by modifying the cost function to deal with the extra nonlinearity due to the joint constraints.},

	Abstract = {Linear path is still widely used to describe the five-axis machining trajectory. Five-axis tool path consists of two parts, one trajectory describes the tool tip position, and the other one represents the second point on tool axis to define the tool orientation. The natural disadvantages of G01 path are tangential and curvature discontinuities at freeform surface, which will lead to feedrate fluctuation and accuracy decrease due to the drive constraints of machine tool. In this study, a path smoothing method is proposed to smooth and optimize the linear path by using dual NURBS curves. Firstly, according to the accuracy requirements, the tool tip spline can be fitted. Secondly, the tool orientation spline can also be obtained by a coordinate system mapping method. Then, the synchronization equation of the two spline parameters is established to achieve interpolation synchronization of cutter location points. Finally, the smoothing dual NURBS tool path can be obtained with continuous curvature to improve the surface quality, motion stability and machining efficiency. Simulations and experiments validate its practicability and reliability. This method is no need to upgrade the CAM, and also could be integrated into CAM system to perform the 5-axis path smoothing.},

However, it is still a challenge to generate trajectories for a mobile robot, given the kinematic and dynamic constraints. In this paper, we present an RRT node extension scheme using an asymptotically stable controller for a two-wheeled mobile robot. The proposed algorithm can generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can deal with the narrow regions efficiently. The computational time of the simulation results shows that the proposed scheme is twice as fast as the conventional approach.},

	Abstract = {Linear toolpath, which is always in forms of a large amount G01 codes, is most popular in practical Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems. The linear toolpath discontinuity will bring the unavoidable fluctuations on velocity and acceleration, leading to unsatisfied machining efficiency and quality. To improve the G01 machining, corners are normally smoothened by various smooth curves and in this paper, a novel two-step method including path-smoothing and feedrate scheduling is proposed. In path-smoothing, a B-spline curve is adopted to blend sharp corners locally and the smooth curvature along transition toolpath is obtained. With constrained chord error, the analytical curvature extreme is proved to occur at the B-spline midpoint and optimal curvature extreme is searched to enhance machining efficiency. In feedrate scheduling, based on the extreme points, a look-ahead methodology is utilized to determine the reachable feedrate at these critical points and a jerk-continuous scheduling scheme is developed afterwards. To verify the proposed method, tracking and machining experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency, contour performance as well as machining quality compared to point-to-point and curvature-continuous methods.},

	Abstract = {Our goal in this research was to develop an efficient motion planning algorithm for a humanoid to enable it to perform complex tasks. To perform the tasks, the humanoid sometimes must be able to generate whole body motion trajectory under the end effector constraints as well as collisions; self-collision and unexpected collision with obstacles in the environment. Also, more complex constraints such as joint limit, joint speed limit would make planning whole body motion more difficult. This constrained redundancy resolution makes the motion planning for humanoid difficult. Although the previous motion planning algorithms are still feasible to find solution, they are typically planning in the high dimensional joint configuration space then finally require high computing. This paper proposes that planning on the specified whole body task space such as pelvis height, chest orientation is able to find feasible solution while satisfying constraints and collision free. We also expect this approach that can be applied on various humanoids so we demonstrated on Atlas and Valkyrie robot. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we applied our motion planning algorithm humanoid performing tasks that are proposed by DARPA challenge such as opening a door, closing valve, cutting wall, pulling emergency switch.},

	Abstract = {The increasing trend towards renewable energy sources requires higher power quality (PQ) at the generation, transmission and distribution systems. The PQ disturbances are produced due to the nonlinear loads, power electronic converters, system faults and switching events. The utilities and consumers of electric power are expected to acquire ideal voltage and current waveforms at rated power frequency. The development of new techniques for the automatic classification of PQ events is at present a major concern. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on the applications of digital signal processing, artificial intelligence and optimization techniques in the classification of PQ disturbances. Various signal processing techniques used for the feature extraction such as Fourier transform, wavelet transform, S-transform, Hilbert transform, Gabor transform and their hybrids have been reviewed. The artificial intelligent techniques used for the pattern recognition such as artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, support vector machine are reviewed in detail. The optimization techniques used for the optimal feature selection such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization are also reviewed. A comparison of various classification systems is presented in tabular form which highlights the important techniques used in the field of PQ disturbance monitoring. The comparison of research works carried out on the classification of PQ disturbances points out that many researchers have focussed on the feature extraction and classification techniques. Only few authors have used the feature selection techniques for selecting the best suitable features. This review may be considered a valuable source for researchers as a reference point to explore the opportunities for further improvement in the field of PQ classification.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to design command inputs for the reduction of residual vibrations in mechanical systems for nonzero initial states. The technique starts with the development of a standard input shaper in a second order oscillator, and adds the initial states of the system to the formulation. However, it is proven that the obtained input shaper does not guarantee a null residual vibration when it is convolved with any unshaped command. To obtain an analytically proven zero-vibration response, it is required to include the parameters that characterize the response of the system to a selected normalized unshaped command in the formulation. By introducing an appropriate processing time delay and by measuring the initial states using a feedback sensor, the proposed method has been applied in a real time scenario where an emergency stop of a crane is required, assuming that initially the payload is swaying. The analyzed systems are those that can be modeled as discrete linear ones and can be described with constant parameter motion equations. Experimental results show the efficacy of the developed method with its application to a scaled crane test platform.},

	Abstract = { Abstract Locomotion of soft-bodied organisms, such as amoeba, worms, and octopuses, is safe, robust, and adaptable and has great promise for applications in complex environments. While such organisms fully exploit the potential provided by their soft structures, engineering solutions commonly constrain soft deformation in favor of controllability. In this study, we study how soft deformations can enhance the climbing capabilities of a robot. We introduce a robot called Longitudinally Extensible Continuum-robot inspired by Hirudinea (LEeCH), which has few shape constraints. Inspired by real leeches, LEeCH has a flexible extensible body and two suction cups at the ends. It is capable of performing 3D climbing locomotion using two suction cups driven by vacuum pumps and tri-tube soft actuators which have only three DC motors. The large deformations occurring in LEeCH extend its workspace compared to robots based on constant curvature models, and we show successful locomotion transition from one surface to another at angles between 0$\,^{\circ}$ and 180$\,^{\circ}$ in experiment. We develop a model based on multibody dynamics to predict the nonlinear deformations of the robot, which we verify in the experiment. The model reveals a nondimensional morphological parameter, which relates the robot's shape to its mass, stiffness, and size. The workspace of LEeCH as a function of this parameter is studied in simulation and is shown to move beyond that of robots based on constant curvature models. },

	Abstract = {Payload hoisting and wind disturbance during crane operations are among the challenging factors that affect a payload sway and thus, affect the crane's performance. This paper proposes a new online adaptive output-based command shaping (AOCS) technique for an effective payload sway reduction of an overhead crane under the influence of those effects. This technique enhances the previously developed output-based command shaping (OCS) which was effective only for a fixed system and without external disturbances. Unlike the conventional input shaping design technique which requires the system's natural frequency and damping ratio, the proposed technique is designed by using the output signal and thus, an online adaptive algorithm can be formulated. To test the effectiveness of the AOCS, experiments are carried out using a laboratory overhead crane with a payload hoisting in the presence of wind, and with different payloads. The superiority of the method is confirmed by 82% and 29% reductions in the overall sway and the maximum transient sway respectively, when compared to the OCS, and two robust input shapers namely Zero Vibration Derivative-Derivative and Extra-Insensitive shapers. Furthermore, the method demonstrates a uniform crane's performance under all conditions. It is envisaged that the proposed method can be very useful in designing an effective controller for a crane system with an unknown payload and under the influence of external disturbances.},

Parameters of the APADRC were adaptively adjusted to ensure the characteristic of the closed loop system to be a given reference system, even if the configuration of the manipulator significantly changes during motion. Because precise parameters of the flexible manipulator are not required in the IS system, the operation of the controller was sufficiently robust to accommodate uncertainties in system parameters.

Unlike most approaches seen in the literature, which are mostly model based and necessitate the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities, the proposed approach is online and can be applied to nonlinear systems with a little knowledge about the structure of the system and the values of its parameters. The stability of the proposed method is proved using an appropriate Lyapunov function. The approach is implemented and tested on a dc motor with nonlinear characteristics and nonlinear state-dependent disturbance. It is shown that it is capable of controlling the system over a network subject to variable network-induced time delay with bounded tracking error. In addition, the effect of packet losses is considered in the implementation part and it is seen that the system can be controlled under these conditions too.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a robotic system that is capable of both picking up and releasing microobjects with high accuracy, reliability, and speed. Due to force-scaling laws, large adhesion forces at the microscale make rapid, accurate release of microobjects a long-standing challenge in micromanipulation, thus representing a hurdle toward automated robotic pick-and-place of micrometer-sized objects. The system employs a novel microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microgripper with a controllable plunging structure to impact a microobject that gains sufficient momentum to overcome adhesion forces. The performance was experimentally quantified through the manipulation of 7.5-10.9 ¿m borosilicate glass spheres in an ambient environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the system, for the first time, achieves a 100% success rate in release (which is based on 700 trials) and a release accuracy of 0.45 $\pm$ 0.24 ¿m. High-speed, automated microrobotic pick-and-place was realized by visually recognizing the microgripper and microspheres, by visually detecting the contact of the microgripper with the substrate, and by vision-based control. Example patterns were constructed through automated microrobotic pick-and-place of microspheres, achieving a speed of 6 s/sphere, which is an order of magnitude faster than the highest speed that has been reported in the literature.},

All these considerations led to experimentations that proved we can reach high accelerations (13 G) and obtain a cycle time of 0.28 s.},

The feedback controller is designed to guarantee trajectory tracking of the joint angle, simplifying thus the input shaper, which can be designed for the arm dynamics only. The input shaper is apudated by an algebraic identification of the natural frequency corresponding to the first vibration mode of the arm. In addition, the influence of the assumptions adopted to derive the algebraic identification on the performance of the estimation is studied. Finally, the proposed adaptive control strategy is implemented in practice.},

	Abstract = {The control of flexible systems has been an active area of research for many years because of its importance to a wide range of applications. The majority of previous research on time-optimal control has concentrated on the rest-to-rest problem. However, there are many cases when flexible systems are not at rest or are subjected to disturbances. This paper presents an approach to design optimal vibration-reducing commands for systems with nonzero initial conditions. The problem is first formulated as an optimal control problem, and the optimal solution is shown to be bang-bang. Once the structure of the optimal command is known, a parametric problem formulation is presented for the computation of the switching times. Solutions are experimentally verified using a portable bridge crane by moving the payload through a commanded motion while removing initial payload swing.},

The controller is analyzed by using it to control an uncertain, time-varying double pendulum using a linear single-pendulum reference model. Single- and double-pendulum dynamics are presented, and the significant natural frequency ranges of the double pendulum are calculated. A Lyapunov control law using only the first mode states of the plant is obtained. An optimization technique is used to obtain the OIS-MRC controller parameters that realizes the shortest time duration, while meeting a set of design constraints. The oscillation suppression, control effort reduction, and disturbance rejection performances of the proposed OIS-MRC controller are tested via numerical simulations and experiments. The OIS-MRC achieves a robust oscillation suppression performance, while reducing the rise time.},

	Abstract = {Micro-electromagnetic actuators have been used in many fields and industries for systems such as microftuidic systems, positioning stages, and robotic manipulators. Small-scale electromagnetic actuators are able to provide rapid motion with high positioning accuracy. The actuator presented in this paper utilizes a displacement amplification mechanism to increase the maximum stroke length that can be achieved. The dynamics of this actuator are nonlinear due to the dependence of the applied force on gap distance between the coils and the amplification mechanism. This nonlinearity causes the performance of PID control to vary with respect to the displacement of the actuator. The control method proposed in this paper to limit the overshoot resulting from nonlinearity uses a combination of PID control and robust input shapers. Using robust input shapers to account for parameter variation across the workspace, the combined controller eliminates the overshoot while maintaining short settling times. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents Continuous Curvature (CC) Steer, a steering method for car-like vehicles, i.e., an algorithm planning paths in the absence of obstacles. CC Steer is the first to compute paths with: 1) continuous curvature; 2) upper-bounded curvature; and 3) upper-bounded curvature derivative. CC Steer also verifies a topological property that ensures that when it is used within a general motion-planning scheme, it yields a complete collision-free path planner. The coupling of CC Steer with a general planning scheme yields a path planner that computes collision-free paths verifying the properties mentioned above. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can follow such paths without ever having to stop in order to reorient its front wheels. Besides, such paths can be followed with a nominal speed which is proportional to the curvature derivative limit. The paths computed by CC Steer are made up of line segments, circular arcs, and clothoid arcs. They are not optimal in length. However, it is shown that they converge toward the optimal "Reeds and Shepp" paths when the curvature derivative upper bound tends to infinity. The capabilities of CC Steer to serve as an efficient steering method within two general planning schemes are also demonstrated.},

	Abstract = { Why is probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planning probabilistic? How does the probability measure used for sampling a robot's configuration space affect the performance of a PRM planner? These questions have received little attention to date. This paper tries to fill this gap and identify promising directions to improve future planners. It introduces the probabilistic foundations of PRM planning and examines previous work in this context. It shows that the success of PRM planning depends mainly and critically on favorable ``visibility'' properties of a robot's configuration space. A promising direction for speeding up PRM planners is to infer partial knowledge of such properties from both workspace geometry and information gathered during roadmap construction, and to use this knowledge to adapt the probability measure for sampling. This paper also shows that the choice of the sampling source---pseudo-random or deterministic---has small impact on a PRM planner's performance, compared with that of the sampling measure. These conclusions are supported by both theoretical and empirical results. },

@article{Plaku:2010a,
	Abstract = {To efficiently solve challenges related to motion-planning problems with dynamics, this paper proposes treating motion planning not just as a search problem in a continuous space but as a search problem in a hybrid space consisting of discrete and continuous components. A multilayered framework is presented which combines discrete search and sampling-based motion planning. This framework is called synergistic combination of layers of planning ( SyCLoP) hereafter. Discrete search uses a workspace decomposition to compute leads, i.e., sequences of regions in the neighborhood that guide sampling-based motion planning during the state-space exploration. In return, information gathered by motion planning, such as progress made, is fed back to the discrete search. This combination allows SyCLoP to identify new directions to lead the exploration toward the goal, making it possible to efficiently find solutions, even when other planners get stuck. Simulation experiments with dynamical models of ground and flying vehicles demonstrate that the combination of discrete search and motion planning in SyCLoP offers significant advantages. In fact, speedups of up to two orders of magnitude were obtained for all the sampling-based motion planners used as the continuous layer of SyCLoP.},

MJ trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint movements and for their amenability to path tracking and to limit robot vibrations. This makes them attractive choices for robotic applications, in spite of the fact that the manipulator dynamics are not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that assures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem. This is solved by a newly devised algorithm based on interval analysis and proof of convergence with certainty to an arbitrarily good global solution is provided. The proposed planning method is applied to an example regarding a six-joint manipulator and comparisons with an alternative MJ planner are exposed.},

	Abstract = { Many sampling based algorithms have been introduced recently. Among them Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is one of the quickest and the most efficient obstacle free path finding algorithm. Although it ensures probabilistic completeness, it cannot guarantee finding the most optimal path. Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*), a recently proposed extension of RRT, claims to achieve convergence towards the optimal solution thus ensuring asymptotic optimality along with probabilistic completeness. However, it has been proven to take an infinite time to do so and with a slow convergence rate. In this paper an extension of RRT*, called as RRT*-Smart, has been prposed to overcome the limitaions of RRT*. The goal of the proposecd method is to accelerate the rate of convergence, in order to reach an optimum or near optimum solution at a much faster rate, thus reducing the execution time. The novel approach of the proposed algorithm makes use of two new techniques in RRT*--Path Optimization and Intelligent Sampling. Simulation results presented in various obstacle cluttered environments along with statistical and mathematical analysis confirm the efficiency of the proposed RRT*-Smart algorithm. },

The problem is first formulated as an optimal control problem and the optimal solution is shown to be bang-bang. Once the structure of the optimal shaper is known, a parametric problem formulation is presented for the computation of the switching times. For digital implementation, discrete time approximate solutions are derived by solving a quasi convex linear program. Simulation results are shown for closed-form implementation of these filters on flexible structures. The digital solutions are experimentally verified on a portable bridge crane.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that a conventional input shaping technique is not very effective in suppressing residual vibrations for non-LTI systems, such as substantially nonlinear or time-varying systems. In an effort to increase the effectiveness for such systems, this paper presents a learning input shaping technique (LIST), which iteratively updates the parameters of the IST from the previous trials. Simulations are presented for 4 different cases: 1) when the natural frequency or damping of a system does not estimated well; 2) when a system has time varying vibration; 3) when a system has nonlinear flexibility; and 4) when a closed loop system includes the saturation limit in the loop. The experiments are made by using a 6-DOF industrial robot to evaluate the method. Results of both the simulations and experiments show that the residual vibrations become considerably smaller as iteration goes on, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the LIST.},

The purpose of the control algorithm was to force the rotor speed to follow the desired reference speed with good accuracy all time. This objective should be achieved for different speed/time tracks regardless of load disturbance and parameter variations.

	Abstract = {The accuracy of the motion control for robotic mechanisms will have an effect on their overall performance. Under the condition where the robotic end-effector carries different loads, the motions for each joint of robotic mechanisms change depending on different payload masses. Conventional control systems possess the potential issue that they cannot compensate the load variation effect. Adaptive control, especially the model reference adaptive control (MRAC), has therefore been put forward to handle the above issue. Adaptive control is generally divided into three categories, model reference, self-tuning and gain-scheduled. In this study, the authors only focus on the model-reference approach. To the best of the authors' knowledge, very few recent research articles can be found in the area of MRAC especially for robotic mechanisms since robotic system is a highly nonlinear system, and it is difficult to guarantee the stability of MRAC in such system. This study presents a review and discussion on the MRAC of robotic mechanisms and some issues of MRAC for robotic mechanisms are also demonstrated. This study can provide a guideline for upcoming research in the field of MRAC for robotic mechanisms.},

@article{Nabae:2015a,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new type of linear actuator using the electromagnetic attractive force, which enables a submillimeter stroke. In general, actuation by the electromagnetic attractive force causes a tradeoff problem between the thrust force and the stroke because the thrust force depends on the gap between the electromagnet and the armature; an increase in the gap (stroke) drastically degrades the thrust force. To realize a submillimeter stroke while retaining a high thrust force, a structure that adopts a displacement amplification mechanism is proposed, which is often used to expand the stroke of a piezoelectric actuator. First, the electromagnetic attractive force is theoretically examined with and without displacement amplification. We verify that displacement amplification could create a higher thrust force and energy efficiency over a certain displacement. On the basis of this examination, a prototype actuator is designed, and the driving principle is illustrated. Further, an analytical model of the proposed actuator is developed for control and performance estimation. Several fundamental experiments with a developed actuator are performed in order to reveal the potential of the proposed actuator. The performance evaluations show that the maximum stroke is approximately 450 μm and a bandwidth greater than 300 Hz can be realized, and more a time constant is approximately 2 ms for a stroke of 450 μm. In addition, the experimental results were compared with the simulation results calculated from the analytical model to verify whether the prototype drives predictably according to the proposed concept under a dynamic situation. These results demonstrate that the proposed actuator enables good actuation performance, and it implies that there are tremendous advantages from the viewpoints of manufacturing, assembly, control, etc.},

	Abstract = {The application of an input precompensation scheme for vibration suppression in slewing flexible structures, with particular application to flexible-link robotic manipulator systems, is considered. The control from such input shaping schemes corresponds to a feedforward term that convolves in real time the desired reference input with a sequence of impulses and produces a vibration-free output. The robustness of such an algorithm with respect to modal frequency variations is not satisfactory but can be improved by convolving the input with a longer sequence of impulses, the tradeoff being a decrease in the transient response speed. An adaptive precompensation scheme that can be implemented by combining a frequency domain identification scheme, used to estimate the modal frequencies online, with a subsequent scheme for adjusting the spacing between the impulses is proposed. The combined adaptive input shaping scheme provides the most rapid slew that results in a vibration-free output. Experimental results for a single flexible link are presented to verify the technique},

Classical path-planning algorithms in artificial intelligence are not designed to deal with wide continuous environments prone to currents. We present a novel Fast Marching (FM)-based approach to address the following issues. First, we develop an algorithm we call FM* to efficiently extract a 2-D continuous path from a discrete representation of the environment. Second, we take underwater currents into account thanks to an anisotropic extension of the original FM algorithm. Third, the vehicle turning radius is introduced as a constraint on the optimal path curvature for both isotropic and anisotropic media. Finally, a multiresolution method is introduced to speed up the overall path-planning process},

	Abstract = {In this study, a path-planning method that has been developed for serial manipulators is adapted to cable-driven robots. The proposed method has two modes. The first one is active when the robot is far from an obstacle. In this mode, the robot moves toward the goal on a straight line. The second mode is active when the robot is near an obstacle. During this mode, the robot finds the best way to avoid the obstacle. Moreover, an algorithm is presented to detect the collision between the robot and the obstacle. A similar algorithm is also presented to avoid the collision of the cables with an obstacle. Some simulation results are shown, which are then validated experimentally using a built 4-cable-driven parallel manipulator. Although the path obtained between the initial and final poses may not be the shortest possible one, it guarantees finding a path, when it exists, no matter how cluttered the environment is. },

Unwanted transient deflection and residual vibration are detrimental to many systems ranging from nano-positioning devices to large industrial cranes. Thousands of researchers have worked diligently for decades to provide solutions to the challenging problems posed by flexible dynamic systems.

This paper provides a review of command-shaping research since it was first proposed in the late 1950's. The important milestones of the research advancements, as well as application examples, are used to illustrate the developments in this important research field.},

	Abstract = {The rapid movement of machines is a challenging control problem because it often results in high levels of vibration. As a result, flexible machines are typically moved relatively slowly. Input shaping is a control method that allows much higher speeds of motion by limiting vibration induced by the reference command. To design an input-shaping controller, estimates of the system natural frequency and damping ratio are required. However, real world systems cannot be modeled exactly, making the robustness to modeling errors an important consideration. Many robust input shapers have been developed, but robust shapers typically have longer durations that slow the system response. This creates a compromise between shaper robustness and rise time. This paper analyzes the compromise between rapidity of motion and shaper robustness for several input-shaping methods. Experimental results from a portable bridge crane verify the theoretical predictions.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a complete coverage path planning and guidance methodology for a mobile robot, having the automatic floor cleaning of large industrial areas as a target application. The proposed algorithms rely on the a priori knowledge of a 2D map of the environment and cope with unexpected obstacles not represented on the map. A template based approach is used to control the path execution, thus incorporating, in a natural way, the kinematic and the geometric model of the mobile robot on the path planning procedure. The novelty of the proposed approach is the capability of the path planner to deal with a priori mapped or unexpected obstacles in the middle of the working space. If unmapped obstacles permanently block the planned trajectory, the path tracking control avoids these obstacles. The paper presents experimental results with a LABMATE mobile robot, confirming the feasibility of the total coverage path and the robustness of the path tracking behaviour based control},

	Abstract = {We consider path planning for a car-like vehicle. Previous solutions to this problem computed paths made up of circular arcs connected by tangential line segments. Such paths have a discontinuous curvature profile. Accordingly a vehicle following such a path has to stop at each curvature discontinuity in order to re-orientate its front wheels. To remove this limitation, we add a continuous-curvature constraint to the problem at hand. In addition, we introduce a constraint on the curvature derivative, so as to reflect the fact that a car-like vehicle can only re-orientate its front wheels with a finite velocity. We propose an efficient solution to the problem at hand that relies upon the definition of a set of paths with continuous curvature and maximum curvature derivative. These paths contain at most eight pieces, each piece being either a line segment, a circular arc of maximum curvature, or a clothoid arc. They are called simple continuous curvature paths. They are used to design a local path planner. The experimental results are presented},

	Abstract = {The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm can be applied to the robotic path planning problem and performs well in challenging, dynamic domains. Traditional RRT methods use a binary cost function and they select portions of the tree for expansion based on the Euclidean distance to the target. However, in outdoor navigation, the relative cost of terrain can also provide useful input to a planning algorithm that traditional RRT methods cannot take advantage of. We present the Metric Adaptive RRT (MA-RRT), which integrates planning and fast execution for generating paths over a cost map. The MA-RRT algorithm considers underlying cost of a path when calculating the distance function for tree expansion. A heuristic value is also used for determining distance from a point to the target and an adaptive mechanism is employed for adjusting the heuristic on-line. We have implemented our approach in offline simulations and in outdoor robot experiments, and show that the MA-RRT algorithm can improve upon the quality of the path returned when cost is considered. The trade off between cost consideration and runtime performance is also presented.},

	Abstract = {Finite impulse-response ``input shapers'' may be used to prefilter inputs to eliminate or minimize residual vibration when maneuvering flexible structures. Vibration is reduced at the expense of adding a delay equal to the length of the shaper. This paper first presents results that aid in the design of ``single-input shapers'' in the discrete domain. Next, \{MIMO\} shaping is considered. Given certain a priori information about the inputs, shorter shapers (which introduce less delay) can be derived. A time-optimal scheme is developed here, and existence of solutions is proved for both \{SISO\} and \{MIMO\} cases. The method is direct, general, easy to implement, and allows for the addition of derivative constraints to improve robustness. Finally, traditional optimal control and input shaping are compared, and it is shown that under certain conditions optimal discrete-time input shaping and discrete time-optimal control are equivalent. },

To overcome this shortcoming, a dynamic model for cable-driven parallel manipulators with cables of slowly time-varying length is presented in this paper. The partial differential equation characterizing the dynamics of a cable with varying-length is deduced, and converted into ordinary differential equations through spatial discretization by finite difference approximation. Then, the dynamic model for cable-driven parallel manipulators is achieved considering the relationship between the motion of the end-effector and the cable end force, in which the degrees of freedom of cables and the end-effector are all involved. Two numerical examples are demonstrated to validate the dynamic model, and also show that it is necessary to take into consideration the cable dynamics for manipulators of long-span cables. },

	Abstract = {Cable-suspended parallel robot (CPR), in which cables are utilized to replace links to manipulate objects, is developed from parallel and serial cable-driven robot. Compared with the parallel robot, this kind of robot has more advantages. The cooperative variation of lengths of six cables pulls the feed cabin to track radio source with six degrees of freedom (DOFs). Similar to a parallel robot, the cable-cabin mechanism for 500-m aperture spherical radio telescope (FAST) can be viewed as a CPR. According to its 5-m scaled model, based on the inverse kinematics analysis the inverse dynamic formulation of \{CPR\} with non-negligible cable mass is established using Lagrangian dynamic formulation. Then, considering random wind forces acted on the cabin are simulated based on the characters of the mechanism, a fuzzy plus proportional--integral control (FPPIC) method, which can enhance the control performance for steady-state errors, is utilized to control the wind-induced vibration of the trajectory tracking of the feed cabin. Finally, we provide the examples of simulation and experiment to justify the dynamic modeling for control and to test the proposed method. },

Natural frequencies as well as associated periodic trajectories that can be obtained from the integration of the dynamic model of an equivalent passive mechanical system are used to design point-to-point trajectories. The trajectories can be used to connect consecutive points in sequence that may lie beyond the static workspace of the robot. The technique ensures zero velocity at each of the target points and continuity of the accelerations. Based on the cable tension constraints, attainable regions can be determined to search for the next target point, while feasible regions of intermediate points are generated in cases for which a given point cannot be directly attained. An example trajectory is performed to illustrate the approach. An experimental implementation is also presented using a three-DOF prototype, and video extensions are provided to demonstrate the results.},

A constrained planar single-link flexible manipulator is considered and the dynamic model of the system is derived using the assume mode method. To study the effectiveness of the controllers, initially a collocated \{PD\} control is developed for control of rigid body motion. This is then extended to incorporate input shaper control schemes for vibration control of the system. The positive and modified specified negative amplitude input shapers are designed based on the properties of the system. Simulation results of the response of the manipulator with the controllers are presented in time and frequency domains. The performances of the hybrid control schemes are examined in terms of level of input tracking capability, vibration reduction, time response specifications and robustness to parameters uncertainty in comparison to the \{PD\} control. Finally, a comparative assessment of the amplitude polarities of the input shapers to the system performance is presented and discussed. },

	Abstract = {Path tracking controllers in mobile robots are aimed at driving the vehicle following a previously defined path. For implementation purposes, the path is discretized into samples. Each sample is theoretically reachable by the robot. Nevertheless, the motion commands could exceed the actuators' limit causing their corresponding saturation, especially when maneuvering in constrained spaces. In this brief, a technique is proposed and implemented for an intelligent sampling of the path to be tracked by an automated vehicle. On the one hand, it is based on finding the best reference in a path in order to improve the controller's performance without compromising the kinematic restrictions of the robot. On the other hand, it uses a probabilistic framework to predict and to avoid collision with moving objects. The proposed methodology is implemented in real time and tested on an agricultural machinery while monitoring a grove, sharing the workspace with field workers, and using the previously published path tracking controllers. The results obtained showed an improvement of 17% (average) of the controllers' performance and an improvement of 40% (average) in the time associated with the navigation process.},

A global path planner is used to generate collision-free straight-line paths from the robot's position to a given goal location. With waypoints of this path, an initial trajectory is generated which defines the planned position of the robot over time. A velocity profile is computed that accounts for constraints on the velocity and acceleration of the robot. The trajectory is refined to minimize the time needed for traversal by an any-time optimization algorithm. An error-feedback controller generates motor commands to execute the planned trajectory. Quintic Be{\^A}¿zier splines are used to allow for curvature-continuous joins of trajectory segments, which enables the system to replan trajectories in order to react to unmapped obstacles.

Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.},

However, like RRT, RRT* is difficult to apply in problems with complicated or underactuated dynamics because it requires the design of a two domain-specific extension heuristics: a distance metric and node extension method. We propose automatically deriving these two heuristics for RRT* by locally linearizing the domain dynamics and applying linear quadratic regulation (LQR). The resulting algorithm, LQR-RRT*, finds optimal plans in domains with complex or underactuated dynamics without requiring domain-specific design choices.

Slightly more information about the system model is taken into account than has been traditionally done with input shaping designs. The input shaping sequences for all system inputs are solved for simultaneously, and the resulting designs lead to shorter impulse sequences than solving for input shaping sequences for each input independently of each other.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the optimal trajectory tracking problem for hybrid systems with discontinuous state trajectories. We consider state-triggered jumps in the state evolution. The tracking of a given reference trajectory is complicated by the fact that the time instants at which the closed-loop dynamics actually jumps differ from those at which the reference trajectory jumps. A recently introduced hybrid feedback tracking controller is used to cope with these differences. A method to design the corresponding time-varying feedback gains such that they minimize a cost criterion in a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) like idea is described in this work. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is investigated numerically by comparison with classic proportional feedback and constant gain hybrid feedback control for a mechanical system with a unilateral position constraint, namely a controlled mass interacting with a rigid obstacle.},

	Abstract = {Motion planning is a key factor in enhancing the autonomy level of unmanned flying vehicles. A new dynamic hybrid algorithm is developed to solve the motion planning problem in real-time using a heuristic optimization approach. The proposed algorithm effectively combines desired features such as rapid convergence to an optimal path with reduced computational effort. In addition to the terrain obstacles, the proposed algorithm is able to avoid random threats that may arise sporadically in the terrain. Using the maneuver automaton concept, nonlinear dynamic model and performance constraints are also considered in the process of motion planning to further ensure feasible trajectories. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm against several simulated scenarios has effectively demonstrated its potential for generating optimal contour-matching trajectories that succeed in avoiding stochastic obstacles. },

	Abstract = {Motion planning under differential constraints is a classic problem in robotics. To date, the state of the art is represented by sampling-based techniques, with the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm as a leading example. Yet, the problem is still open in many aspects, including guarantees on the quality of the obtained solution. In this paper we provide a thorough theoretical framework to assess optimality guarantees of sampling-based algorithms for planning under differential constraints. We exploit this framework to design and analyze two novel sampling-based algorithms that are guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an optimal solution (namely, the Differential Probabilistic RoadMap algorithm and the Differential Fast Marching Tree algorithm). Our focus is on driftless control-affine dynamical models, which accurately model a large class of robotic systems. In this paper we use the notion of convergence in probability (as opposed to convergence almost surely): the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach yields convergence rate bounds - a first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints. Numerical experiments corroborating our theoretical results are presented and discussed.},

	Abstract = {In this study, a novel time-optimal off-line trajectory planning method, together with a tracking controller, is proposed for a two-dimensional (2D) underactuated overhead crane. Specifically, based on the differential flatness technique, a flat output of the system is firstly defined to deal with the coupling between the payload swing and trolley motion, whose trajectory is parameterised to be a B-spline curve with unknown parameters when considering the continuity and smoothness requirements. Various constraints, including swing bound, allowable trolley acceleration, and so on, are then taken into consideration to convert the parameters determination task into an optimisation problem, with the solution employed to construct a high-efficient trolley trajectory with an analytical expression. To enhance tracking performance, a non-linear tracking control law is subsequently designed based on the feedback linearisation technique, whose performance is ensured with theoretical analysis. Finally, some simulation and experimental results are included to demonstrate that the proposed trajectory planning/tracking scheme achieves satisfactory performance for underactuated cranes.},

To achieve this aim for a truck and trailer vehicle, the paper proposes the use of a parameterized curve primitive, the η4-spline. Using this spline, generation and shaping of smooth feasible paths is made possible as well as the transfer between arbitrary dynamic configurations of the articulated vehicle. The η4-spline is a ninth-order polynomial curve that can interpolate given Cartesian points with associated arbitrary unit tangent vector, curvature, and first and second derivatives of curvature. It depends on a set of eight (eta) parameters that can be freely chosen to modify the path shape without changing the interpolations conditions at the path endpoints. Completeness, minimality, and symmetry of the η4-spline are established. An example on a parking maneuver of the articulated vehicle is presented and the pertinent optimal path planning is also discussed.},

This two step method combines an extremely fast global planner operating on a simple sensor based environment modeling, while it operates at the sensor frequency. The main characteristics are speed and reliability, because the map dimensions are reduced to a unidimensional map and this map represents the safest areas in the environment for moving the robot},

@article{Ang:2005a,
	Abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of "plug-and-play" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},

This is the problem of planning a path through a continuous domain Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are a recently developed representation on which fast continuous domain path planners can be based. In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.},

	N2 = {Input shaping is a control method that limits motion-induced oscillation in vibratory systems by intelligently shaping the reference command. As with any control method, the robustness of input shaping to parameter variations and modeling errors is an important consideration. For input shaping, there exists a fundamental compromise between robustness to such errors and system rise time. For all types of shapers, greater robustness requires a longer duration shaper, which degrades rise time. However, if a shaper is allowed to contain negative impulses, then the shaper duration may be shortened with only a small cost of robustness and possible high-mode excitation. This paper presents a thorough analysis of the compromise between shaper duration, robustness, and possible high-mode excitation for several negative input-shaping methods. In addition, a formulation for specified negative amplitude, specified insensitivity shapers is presented. These shapers provide a continuous spectrum of solutions for the duration/robustness/high-mode excitation trade-off. Experimental results from a portable bridge crane verify the theoretical predictions.},

Through these definitions, two classes of simple paths are obtained, namely the set of circular arcs and the set of cubic spirals. A cubic spiral is a curve whose tangent direction is described by a cubic function of path distance s. These sets of simple paths are used for solving path planning problems of symmetric posture (position and orientation) pairs. For a nonsymmetric posture pair, two simple paths are used as a solution, based on the fact that the locus of split postures is a circle or a straight line. A posture q is said to be a split posture of a pair (p1,p2) of postures, if p1 and q are symmetric and so are q and p2. The resultant solutions are smoother than those obtained using clothoid curves. This algorithm has been successfully implemented on the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11},

In RRTs, randomization is used to create Voronoi bias, which causes the search trees to rapidly explore the state space. Our algorithms take steps to increase the Voronoi bias and to retain this property without the use of randomization. Studying these and related algorithms would improve our understanding of how efficient exploration can be accomplished, and would hopefully lead to improved planners.

	Abstract = {Contouring control is an important issue in industrial applications. For better product quality and higher productivity, achieving higher contour tracking performance with feed rate as large as possible is essential. However, most existing research has focused on improving contour tracking accuracy only. The potential instability issue due to control input saturation under high feed-rate operations has been largely ignored. In this paper, the minimum time trajectory planning problem is formulated as a step toward solving this practically important problem. A novel back and forward check algorithm is developed to take into account physical constraints of the system when generating the desired trajectory to be followed. Compared with traditional numerical searching methods, the proposed algorithm is very computationally efficient because the optimal solution at each node can be obtained by several analytical equations directly. Moreover, the algorithm can incorporate some velocity-dependent constraints easily. Planning a Lissajous curve is used as the case study to verify the optimality and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are conducted on an industrial biaxial gantry. Several implementation issues on tracking complicated contours are discussed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed trajectory planning approach enables simultaneous achievement of high contouring tracking accuracy and higher feed rate or shorter operation time.},

This problem has great practical significance in many UAV applications. However, it has received little attention in the literature so far. Flying with a suspended load can be a very challenging and sometimes hazardous task as the suspended load significantly alters the flight characteristics of the quadrotor. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a technique based on dynamic programming which ensures swing-free trajectory tracking. We start by presenting the mathematical model of a quadrotor with suspended load dynamics and kinematics. A high-level planner is used to provide desired waypoints, and then a dynamic programming approach is used to generate the swing-free trajectory for the quadrotor carrying a suspended load. Effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

	Abstract = {A major open issue in the design and operation of cable-direct-driven-robots (CDDRs) is ensuring tensile cable forces for any admissible motion of the CDDR. Such a problem is particularly challenging when underconstrained and non-redundant \{CDDR\} configurations are considered. In this paper a new and general trajectory planning method is introduced, which has been specifically developed to ensure always positive and bounded cable tensions in underconstrained planar two-degree-of-freedom translational CDDRs. The proposed method translates the typical bilateral force constraints of the cables (i.e. positive and bounded tensions) into constraints on the velocity and acceleration of the \{CDDR\} end-effector along the path. Such constraints are computed making use of the robot dynamic model and are then incorporated in a suitable trajectory planning algorithm also yielding the minimum traversal time. The method is explained and validated numerically by applying it to a novel concept of underconstrained hybrid (serial/parallel) CDDR. The results achieved prove that the proposed method may a priori ensure positive and bounded cable tensions along any straight line and circular path. },

	Abstract = {A cable-driven parallel manipulator is a manipulator whose end-effector is driven by a number of parallel cables instead of rigid links. Since cables always have more flexibility than rigid links, a cable manipulator bears a concern of possible vibration. Thus, investigation of vibration of cable manipulators caused by cable flexibility is important for applications requiring high system stiffness or bandwidth. This paper provides a vibration analysis of general 6-DOF cable-driven parallel manipulators. Based on the analysis of the natural frequencies of the multibody system, the study demonstrates that a cable manipulator can be designed stiff enough for special applications like the cable-manipulator based hardware-in-the-loop simulation of contact dynamics. Moreover, under an excitation, a cable may vibrate not only in its axial direction, but also in its transversal direction. The paper also analyzes the vibration of cable manipulators caused by cable flexibilities in both axial and transversal directions. It is shown that the vibration of a cable manipulator due to the transversal vibration of cables can be ignored comparing to that due to the axial flexibility of cables.},

Input shaping, a feed-forward method, typically convolves the input with a sequence of impulses that are independent of the system maneuver. While reducing the residual vibration, input shaping extends the duration of the maneuver command by the length of the input shaper. This paper explores the idea of adaptive input shaping which allows a fast input shaper to be used while providing robustness to parameter uncertainty by tuning the shaper to the flexible mode frequency. The adaptive input shaping method presented can adapt between maneuvers or during maneuvers. Analysis yields a large range of convergence that is verified by simulation and shows this method to be less complex than other adaptive approaches.},

	Abstract = {Input shaping is a vibration control technique that operates by filtering reference commands so that the modified (or shaped) command does not excite the system's natural frequencies. Usually input shaping is limited to a filtering operation outside of any feedback loops. However, this implementation prevents input shaping from effecting some vital control applications including disturbance rejection, initial condition response, etc. Therefore, some research has suggested using input shapers within feedback loops. This paper will present some initial investigations toward the fundamental understanding of how input shapers utilized within feedback loops affect closed loop stability.},

To overcome the design difficulty from nondifferential saturation nonlinearity, a smooth nonlinear function of the control input signal is first introduced to approximate the saturation function; then, an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller based on the mean-value theorem is constructed by using backstepping technique. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability and the system output eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the desired reference signal in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

	Abstract = {The design of Model-Reference Adaptive Control for MIMO linear systems has not yet achieved, in spite of significant efforts, the completeness and simplicity of its SISO counterpart. One of the main obstacles has been the generalization of the SISO assumption that the sign of the high-frequency gain (HFG) is known. Here we overcome this obstacle and present a more complete MIMO analog to the well known Lyapunov-based SISO design which is significantly less restrictive than the existing analogs. Our algorithm makes use of a new control parametrization derived from a factorization of the HFG matrix Kp=SDU, where S is symmetric positive definite, D is diagonal, and U is unity upper triangular. Only the signs of the entries of D or, equivalently, the signs of the leading principal minors of Kp, are assumed to be known.},

@article{Kaitwanidvilai:2005a,
	Abstract = {The dynamic model of a force control system depends not only on the actuator but also on the manipulated object. Generally the object dynamics are unknown and frequently change, and it therefore is difficult to identify the actual dynamics of the system. Designing a nonadaptive controller to perform well under unknown and variant conditions is not feasible. To enhance the controller performance for the pneumatic system, in this paper, a hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy model reference is proposed. The concept of multimode switching is applied to activate either a `bang--bang' controller or an adaptive neuro-fuzzy model reference controller (ANFMRC). Bang--bang control is applied when the actual output is far away from set point, which results in high error value. In this mode, fast tracking of the output is required. ANFMRC is applied in medium and small error ranges to perform a good response. In this paper, two types of controller; ANFMRC and hybrid ANFMRC are investigated. Simulation and experiment of a force controlled pneumatic system is investigated to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

	Abstract = {The subject of magnetic actuators is very broad, and encompasses various technologies, as well as a wide range of magnetic circuit topologies and performance characteristics, for an ever-increasing spectrum of applications in all market sectors. Magnetic actuators can be rotary or linear, and can have continuous or limited motion, the basic classes being moving-coil, moving-iron and moving-magnet. Within these, the airgap length may either remain constant or vary with displacement, and while the majority of such actuators have only one degree-of-freedom, systems are emerging which are capable of providing multiple degrees-of-freedom of controlled motion. In view of the breadth of the subject, the paper focuses on research which is being undertaken in the Electrical Machines and Drives Group at the University of Sheffield on some specific magnetic actuation systems. These include:*Aerospace---electromechanical and electro-hydraulic actuators for flight control surfaces,*Automotive---short-stroke actuators, for applications such as high-speed diesel fuel injector control valves; active and passive magnetic bearing actuation systems for electric vehicle flywheel energy storage units,*Industrial---long stroke linear motors for high-speed packaging and manufacturing applications,*Healthcare---reciprocating linear actuators for resonant electro-mechanical systems, such as positive-displacement diaphragm air-compressors,*Computer---multi-degree-of-freedom spherical actuators for force-feedback joysticks, manipulators etc. As will be highlighted, much of the research involves the application of high-energy rare-earth permanent magnets, which have facilitated the development of new and improved performance magnetic actuators.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a point-to-point dynamic trajectory planning technique for reaching a series of poses with a six-degree-of-freedom (six-DOF) cable-suspended parallel robot. Each trajectory segment is designed to have zero translational and rotational velocity at its endpoints; transitions between segments have translational and rotational acceleration continuity. This formulation facilitates the synthesis of trajectories that extend beyond the static workspace of the robot. A basis motion is introduced, which is a mathematical function that can be adapted for each coordinate direction along each trajectory segment. Kinematic constraints are satisfied through the selection of the coefficients for this function. Dynamic constraints are imposed by defining feasible regions within the workspace for each segment endpoint, based on the previous endpoint. Spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) is used to produce singularity-free, optimally interpolated rotational trajectory segments. An experimental implementation is presented using a six-DOF prototype and a supplementary video file is included to demonstrate the results.},

	Abstract = {Precise manipulation of payloads is difficult with cranes. Oscillation can be induced into the lightly damped system by motion of the bridge or trolley, or from environmental disturbances. To address both sources of oscillation, a combined feedback and input shaping controller is developed. The controller is comprised of three distinct modules. A feedback module detects and compensates for positioning error; a second feedback module detects and rejects disturbances; input shaping is used in a third module to mitigate motion-induced oscillation. An accurate model of vector drive and AC induction motors, typical to large cranes, was used jointly with a deconvolution analysis technique to incorporate the nonlinear dynamics of crane actuators into the control design. The controller is implemented on a 10-ton bridge crane at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The controller achieves good positioning accuracy and significant sway reduction.},

	Abstract = {We present a new approach to path planning for deformable linear (one-dimensional) objects such as flexible wires. We introduce a method for efficiently computing stable configurations of a wire subject to manipulation constraints. These configurations correspond to minimal-energy curves. By restricting the planner to minimal-energy curves, the execution of a path becomes easier. Our curve representation is adaptive in the sense that the number of parameters automatically varies with the complexity of the underlying curve. We introduce a planner that computes paths from one minimal-energy curve to another such that all intermediate curves are also minimal-energy curves. This planner can be used as a powerful local planner in a sampling-based roadmap method. This makes it possible to compute a roadmap of the entire "shape space," which is not possible with previous approaches. Using a simplified model for obstacles, we can find minimal-energy curves of fixed length that pass through specified tangents at given control points. Our work has applications in cable routing, and motion planning for surgical suturing and snake-like robots},

	Abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental research area in robotics. Sampling-based methods offer an efficient solution for what is otherwise a rather challenging dilemma of path planning. Consequently, these methods have been extended further away from basic robot planning into further difficult scenarios and diverse applications. A comprehensive survey of the growing body of work in sampling-based planning is given here. Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed. The aim of this paper is to survey the state of the art in motion planning and to assess selected planners, examine implementation details and above all shed a light on the current challenges in motion planning and the promising approaches that will potentially overcome those problems.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new trajectory generation scheme called dual-tree rapidly exploring random tree (DT-RRT), which is designed on the basis of a rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) method. The DT-RRT is suitable for high-speed navigation of a two-wheeled differential mobile robot. The proposed dual tree is composed of a workspace tree and a state tree. The workspace tree finds near sets in the target workspace without considering robot kinematics. Robot trajectories are generated by the extension of the state tree under the consideration of kinematic and dynamic constraints. The proposed scheme allows for different topological structures between the workspace tree and the state tree. Owing to the different structures between two trees, flexible node extensions can be achieved. As a result, the success rate of the node extension can be increased, while the computational cost can be saved. In order to improve the quality of the trajectory, we propose a reconnect-tree scheme that can modify the generated tree structure. The advantage of the reconnect-tree scheme is that the repropagation of the conventional RRT structure is not required. From simulations, the superior performance of DT-RRT was clarified in terms of computing time and success rate. The experimental result supported high quality of the generated trajectory with fast and smooth motion of the robot.},

For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space).

Our main contribution is the characterization of a class of systems for which IDA-PBC yields a smooth asymptotically stabilizing controller with a guaranteed domain of attraction. The class is given in terms of solvability of certain partial differential equations. One important feature of IDA-PBC, stemming from its Hamiltonian formulation, is that it provides new degrees of freedom for the solution of these equations. Using this additional freedom, we are able to show that the method of "controlled Lagrangians"-in its original formulation-may be viewed as a special case of our approach. As illustrations we design asymptotically stabilizing IDA-PBCs for the classical ball and beam system and a novel inertia wheel pendulum.},

For systems with dynamics, the local planner corresponds to a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) solver, which is not always available. Furthermore, asymptotically optimal solutions tend to increase computational costs relative to alternatives, such as RRT, that focus on feasibility. This paper describes a sampling-based solution with the following desirable properties: a) it does not require a BVP solver but only uses a forward propagation model, b) it employs a single propagation per iteration similar to RRT, making it very efficient, c) it is asymptotically near-optimal, and d) provides a sparse data structure for answering path queries, which further improves computational performance. Simulations on prototypical dynamical systems show the method is able to improve the quality of feasible solutions over time and that it is computationally efficient.},

	Abstract = {We present an approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for kinodynamic systems with arbitrary nonlinear dynamics amid obstacles. Optimal sampling-based planners like RRT*, FMT*, and BIT* when applied to kinodynamic systems require solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) to perform exact connections between nodes in the tree. Two-point BVPs are non-trivial to solve, hence the prevalence of alternative approaches that focus on specific instances of kinodynamic systems, use approximate solutions to the two-point BVP, or use random propagation of controls. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting recent advances in numerical optimal control and optimization to solve these two-point BVPs for arbitrary kinodynamic systems and how they can be integrated with existing optimal planning algorithms. We combine BIT* with a two-point BVP solver that uses sequential quadratic programming (SQP). We consider the problem of computing minimum-time trajectories. Since the duration of trajectories is not known a-priori, we include the time-step as part of the optimization to allow SQP to optimize over the duration of the trajectory while keeping the number of discrete steps fixed for every connection attempted. Our experiments indicate that using a two-point BVP solver in the inner-loop of BIT* is competitive with the state-of-the-art in sampling-based optimal planning that explicitly avoids the use of two-point BVP solvers.},

@article{Chen:2009a,
	Abstract = {Residual vibrations generated from rest-to-rest maneuvers are crucial for applications in precision engineering, active structural control, space engineering, and other mechatronics applications. In certain applications, the structures to be controlled could be highly nonlinear yet lightly damped. Although the traditional input shaping techniques, which utilize destructive interference, work well for linear and weakly nonlinear systems, they show little effects on systems with strong nonlinearity. In this paper, a general input shaper design methodology for single-degree-of-freedom systems with Duffing nonlinearity is developed by an energy approach. Following this approach, two-step and three-step shapers, as well as their design procedures, are developed, which in the linear limit reduce to the traditional zero-vibration and zero-vibration-and-derivative shapers, respectively. The robustness of these nonlinear shapers is investigated numerically through case studies. The results show that the three-step shapers are sufficiently robust to resist certain level of parameter variations (from their designed values) without exciting significant residual vibrations. The two-step shapers, however, are less robust in comparison. Meanwhile, it is also found that the presence of damping effectively disturbs the energy flow and thus induces residual vibrations. For the less robust two-step shapers, an effective `online tuning' scheme is also proposed here to further improve its performance in a damped nonlinear system. These shaping schemes, as well as their practical adjustment routing, could be applied to the particular structural or mechatronics systems with Duffing or other nonlinearities for vibration suppression to enhance the performance of mechatronics systems.},

	Abstract = {Robotic motion planning requires configuration space exploration. In high-dimensional configuration spaces, a complete exploration is computationally intractable. Practical motion planning algorithms for such high-dimensional spaces must expend computational resources in proportion to the local complexity of configuration space regions. We propose a novel motion planning approach that addresses this problem by building an incremental, approximate model of configuration space. The information contained in this model is used to direct computational resources to difficult regions, effectively addressing the narrow passage problem by adapting the sampling density to the complexity of that region. In addition, the expressiveness of the model permits predictive edge validations, which are performed based on the information contained in the model rather then by invoking a collision checker. Experimental results show that the exploitation of the information obtained through sampling and represented in a predictive model results in a significant decrease in the computational cost of motion planning.},

	Abstract = {This brief proposes a motion planning-based adaptive control strategy for an underactuated overhead crane system. To improve the transportation efficiency and enhance the safety of the crane system, the trolley is required to reach the desired position fast enough, while the swing of the payload needs to be within an acceptable domain. To achieve these objectives, a novel two-step design strategy consisting of a motion planning stage and an adaptive tracking control design stage, is proposed to control such an underactuated system as an overhead crane. Specifically, a novel desired trajectory, which satisfies physical constraints of an overhead crane, is proposed for the trolley by fusing theoretical analysis results with the conventional empirical trajectory planning methods. An adaptive control law is then constructed in the second step to make the trolley track the planned trajectory, where some online update mechanism is introduced to ensure that the controller works well with different working conditions. As shown by Lyapunov techniques, the proposed adaptive controller guarantees asymptotic tracking result even in the presence of uncertainties including system parameters and various disturbance. Some experiment results demonstrate that the proposed control method achieves superior performance for the underactuated cranes.},

	Abstract = {Planning the path of an autonomous, agile vehicle in a dynamic environment is a very complex problem, especially when the vehicle is required to use its full maneuvering capabilities. Recent efforts aimed at using randomized algorithms for planning the path of kinematic and dynamic vehicles have demonstrated considerable potential for implementation on future autonomous platforms. This paper builds upon these efforts by proposing a randomized path planning architecture for dynamical systems in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles. This architecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion, and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling between low-level control and motion planning. The path planning algorithm retains the convergence properties of its kinematic counterparts. System safety is also addressed in the face of finite computation times by analyzing
the behavior of the algorithm when the available onboard computation resources are limited, and the planning must be performed in real time. The proposed algorithm can be applied to vehicles whose dynamics are described either by ordinary differential equations or by higher-level, hybrid representations. Simulation examples involving a ground robot and a small autonomous helicopter are presented and discussed.},

	Abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) have been recently proposed as an effective approach to computationally hard motion planning problem. However, while the RRT algorithm is known to be able to find a feasible solution quickly, there are no guarantees on the quality of such solution, e.g., with respect to a given cost functional. To address this limitation, the authors recently proposed a new algorithm, called RRT*, which ensures asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost sure convergence of the solution returned by the algorithm to an optimal solution, while maintaining the same properties of the standard RRT algorithm, both in terms of computation of feasible solutions, and of computational complexity. In this paper, the RRT* algorithm is extended to deal with differential constraints. A sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality is provided. It is shown that the RRT* algorithm equipped with any local steering procedure that satisfies this condition converges to an optimal solution almost surely. In particular, simple local steering procedures are provided for a Dubins' vehicle as well as a double integrator. Simulation examples are also provided for these systems comparing the RRT and the RRT* algorithms.},

	Abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Ran- dom Trees (RRTs), have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic com- pleteness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms, e.g., in terms of a given cost function, have been established so far. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental sampling- based algorithms with provable optimality properties. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned by RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as the number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called RRT∗, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT$^*$ algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

	Abstract = {The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, based on incremental sampling, efficiently computes motion plans. Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor "anytime" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods. We also demonstrate experimental results for an outdoor wheeled robotic vehicle.},

Then, applying both the constrant conditions and the initial and final condistions of the joint angular velocities, the trajectory of the two-link flexible robot arm is expressed by use of the four unknown parameters. Then, the fitness function of the genetic algorithm for the residual vibration reduction of the second flexible link is defined using the four unknown parameters as the genes, and the optimal trajectory planning algorithm is constructed by use of the genetic algorithm.

	Abstract = {This brief presents a trajectory planning algorithm for aerial vehicles traveling in 3-D space while avoiding obstacles. The nature of the obstacles can be, for example, radar detection areas, cooperating and non-cooperating vehicles, and so on. Thus, it is a complex trajectory planning problem. The proposed planner is based on the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm. Artificial potential fields are combined with the RRT* algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed to a suboptimal solution by biasing the random state generation. The performance of this framework is demonstrated on a complex missile application in a heterogeneous environment. Indeed, since the air density decreases exponentially with altitude, the maneuverability of the aerial vehicle depending on aerodynamic forces also decreases exponentially with altitude. To face this problem, the shortest paths of Dubins-like vehicles traveling in a heterogeneous environment are used to build the metric. In the simulation results, this framework can find the first solution with fewer iterations than the RRT and the RRT* algorithm. Moreover, the final solution obtained within a given number of iterations is closer to an optimal solution regarding the considered criterion.},

	Abstract = {A novel method is presented for producing dead-bea response in a lightly-damped oscillatory feedback system. Complete transient response times of the order of a fraction of the natural oscillatory period can be obtained. Excellent waveshape reproduction is achieved through a linear phase lag with frequency. The method consists of exciting several transient oscillations, at closely spaced times, with magnitudes and phases so adjusted that the resultant sum of the transient oscillation phasors is zero. The steady-state output is the arithmetic sum of the excitation magnitudes. When a step input transient is divided into two spaced excitations, one-half cycle response is obtainable. When the input transient is divided into three excitations, one-fourth period or faster transient times are realizable, depending upon the available dynamic range or signal-to-noise ratio. The principle of design is to adjust a system to the maximum possible resonant frequency, independent of the damping factor, but stable, and then to apply the Posicast control to completely remove the oscillatory component in the output. In an electrical feedback control system, the additional hardware consists of one or two artificial transmission lines.},

As USVs are required to carry out complex missions without any human intervention in various environments, an intelligent path planning algorithm is critical. A path planning algorithm is able to utilise environment data to calculate an optimal trajectory to guarantee safety. To achieve this, in this paper, a novel path planning and navigation (PN) algorithm is proposed. The PN algorithm uses the fast marching method (FMM) as the base algorithm to search for an optimal collision-free trajectory. Then, to facilitate the trajectory tracking of the USV, a new waypoint-generator based on the line-of-sight (LOS) is developed to generate the optimal number of waypoints from the path. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated based on the Springer USV, and has been shown that it can be seamlessly integrated with the Springer's exiting autopilot to achieve full autonomy.},

We initially present an optimization cost function that proves to be better suited for the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicles that are the focus of this work. We also propose an improvement for the Alternating Algorithm, used to determinate the orientation angles on the calculation of the Dubins' Path through the waypoints. Finally, we use a recently developed optimization meta-heuristic, called Continuous-GRASP (C-GRASP), to generate a path that is shorter than paths obtained with classical techniques. Our results show significant improvements on the search for optimal paths for the case of nonholonomic vehicles. Our methodology was thoroughly evaluated and validated in simulation, and the results have shown a decrease on path's length of 28% on average, compared with the classic technique found in literature. In some cases a reduction of approximately 50% was obtained.},

Single crane control systems that compensate for own ship or target ship motion and payload swing damping are well developed, and have been demonstrated. Cargo transfer control is more complex when multiple ship-mounted cranes are used, representing a closed kinematic chain. However, the potential benefits include larger capacity and better load control. In this brief, an inverse kinematic control strategy is presented that uses two cranes' actuation capability (hoist lengths and boom angles) to keep its load fixed in inertial space regardless of the motion of the ship on which the cranes are mounted. An underdetermined solution is developed. Unique crane commands can then be computed using a minimum norm solution. A dynamic simulation is described for use in algorithm development and initial validation. Final verification was performed using two cranes mounted on a motion controlled platform.},

The A* method can be extremely slow for large numbers of cells to be searched. The alternative presented is to use trial vectors that span several cells to aid in the planning. The fine resolution of the obstacle mapping is maintained. A loose search is performed on the fine grid. The paths that are found using this method are slightly sub-optimal. The speed of the searching algorithm is significantly increased. Solution times for three-dimensional problems are typically below 100 milliseconds, while the traditional A* search for the same problem is several minutes. The trade-off is a large speed increase for a slight degradation in path length optimality. Two-dimensional problems are solved very quickly.},

	Abstract = {Determination of a collision free path for a robot between start and goal positions through obstacles cluttered in a workspace is central to the design of an autonomous robot path planning. This paper presents an overview of autonomous mobile robot path planning focusing on algorithms that produce an optimal path for a robot to navigate in an environment. To complete the navigation task, the algorithms will read the map of the environment or workspace and subsequently attempts to create free paths for the robot to traverse in the workspace without colliding with objects and obstacles. Appropriate or correct and suitable algorithms will fulfill its function fast enough, that is, to find an optimal path for the robot to traverse in, even if there are a large number of obstacles cluttered in a complex environment. To achieve this, various approaches in the design of algorithms used to develop an ideal path planning system for autonomous mobile robots have been proposed by many researchers. Simulation and experimental results from previous research shows that algorithms play an important role to produce an optimal path (short, smooth and robust) for autonomous robot navigation and simultaneously it prove that appropriate algorithms can run fast enough to be used practically without time-consuming problem. This paper presents an overview and discusses the strength and weakness of path planning algorithms developed and used by previous and current researchers.},

	Abstract = {Micro milling requires both high speed and high accuracy in order to economically produce parts with features on the scale of 1 μm. Micro mills are smaller and more flexible than traditional large-scale machines. Therefore, vibration of the machine structure is a significant problem. Given that micro milling requires high positioning precision, even small vibrations in the controller dynamics are problematic. The small-scale operation has considerably lower tool/workpiece interaction forces than traditional-scale milling. These low cutting forces have minimal effect on the machine structural response. Therefore, the dominant dynamic factor in exciting vibration can be the machine tool motion, rather than the workpiece/tool interaction. Given this realization, properly shaping the motions of the micro mill is a promising approach to reduce vibration. This paper presents a nonlinear command-shaping technique to reduce the vibrations of a micro mill that can be implemented with a standard CNC controller. The robustness of this technique to modeling errors and disturbances is investigated. Theoretical proofs and experimental demonstrations of the command-shaping technique are presented. The improved performance from the command shaping enables higher throughput and improved accuracy of the micro mill.

	Abstract = {Command shaping creates reference commands that reduce residual vibrations in a flexible system. This thesis examines the use of command shaping for flexible system control in three industrial applications: cam-follower systems, sloshing liquids, and cherrypickers. One common type of command shaping is command smoothing which creates a smooth transition between setpoints. A specific type of command smoothing used in cam-follower systems is the polynomial profile. An alternative technique to reduce vibration in flexible systems is input shaping. In this thesis, input-shaped commands are compared to polynomial profiles for applications requiring both vibration suppression and fast motion. Simulation and experimental results show that input shaping is faster than polynomial profiles and provides a simple approach to suppressing residual vibration.
 
 Secondly, significant experimental contributions have been made in the area of slosh control. The oscillation of liquids in a container can cause liquid spillage or can cause stability issues, especially in space vehicles. In the past, a number of control techniques have been proposed, but only a few recommend the use of input shaping. This thesis describes the use of command shaping to limit slosh. Results are supported by numerical and experimental testing. Input-shaped commands reduce residual slosh amplitude compared to unshaped commands and polynomial profiles. Input-shaped commands can also accommodate uncertainties and changes in the sloshing frequencies.
 
 Lastly, a small-scale cherrypicker was constructed to study the use of input-shaping control on these types of aerial lifts. Cherrypickers have flexible dynamic effects that can cause dangerous and life-threatening situations. To study this class of machines and to provide future students an experimental testbed, several design criteria were established before construction began. The resulting machine achieved most design objectives, including a simple-to-use graphical user interface and accurate state measurements. Robust input-shaping controllers were implemented to limit endpoint vibration. The design of the cherrypicker is discussed and experimental results are reported.},

	Abstract = {The residual vibration of flexible systems can be reduced by shaping the reference command with notch filters, low-pass filters, and input shapers. Since the introduction of robust input shaping, there has been substantial evidence that input shaping is better than both notch and low-pass filtering for suppressing vibration in mechanical systems. Much of this evidence is empirical comparisons between traditional filters and robust input shapers. Given the large variety of filters and shapers and the large number of design strategies and parameters, there is still some uncertainty as to which approach is better. This paper seeks to end this debate by proving that notch and low-pass filters are never better than input shapers for suppressing mechanical vibration. This paper expands on previous efforts by presenting a proof showing that input shapers suppress vibration more quickly than notch or low-pass filters. The problem of suppressing multi-mode vibration is also examined. Experimental results from a portable bridge crane verify key theoretical results.},

	Abstract = {Cable-driven parallel manipulators are one of the best solutions to achieving large workspace since flexible cables can be easily stored on reels. However, due to the negligible flexural stiffness of cables, long cables will unavoidably vibrate during operation for large workspace applications. In this paper a finite element model for cable-driven parallel manipulators is proposed to mimic small amplitude vibration of cables around their desired position. Output feedback of the cable tension variation at the end of the end-effector is utilized to design the vibration attenuation controller which aims at attenuating the vibration of cables by slightly varying the cable length, thus decreasing its effect on the end-effector. When cable vibration is attenuated, motion controller could be designed for implementing precise large motion to track given trajectories. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the dynamic model and the control algorithm. 1. Introduction Cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs) are parallel mechanisms where rigid links are replaced with flexible cables actuated by winches. CDPMs possess several merits, such as large workspace, low inertia, and economical construction and maintenance. Since cables can be easily stored on reels, CDPMs have the great potential to achieve very large workspace. For many applications where extreme workspace is demanded, CDPMs seem to be one of the best solutions. Some representative examples of large workspace applications include cable-driven scaffold system [1], cable-driven camera system [2], and feed supporting system for large radio telescopes [3], as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Some representative applications of large CDPMs. Many works have been done on CDPMs with the assumption that cables are massless and can be treated as straight lines [4, 5]. This assumption omits the dynamics of the cable itself. For large workspace applications, cables commonly are of relatively big cross-sectional area to withstand heavy payload and are prone to vibration which will result in the vibration of the end-effector. Theoretically, cables should be considered as a distributed mass system to model their vibration. Dynamic characteristics of cables have been widely researched, though they do not attract enough attention for CDPMs. Terumichi et al. studied the nonstationary vibration of a string with time-varying length attached to a mass-spring system, analytically studying the dynamics of elevators [6]. Wang et al. investigated the vibrations of a geometrically nonlinear cable with time-dependent length},
